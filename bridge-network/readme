## Steps
```
1. On host machine: Install a KVM Virtualization packages

   * $ sudo apt install bridge-utils libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-daemon  qemu qemu-kvm  virt-manager
   * $ sudo systemctl start libvirtd
   * $ sudo systemctl enable libvirtd   
   
2. On host machine : Creating a Bridge Network "br0" and new host-bridge network for creating vm in KVM

   * Create the Netplan configuration file /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
   * Create a file named host-bridge.xml with following content
      <network>
      <name>host-bridge</name>
      <forward mode="bridge"/>
      <bridge name="br0"/>
      </network>
   * Create the script file "netplan.sh"
   * Add executable permission for the script file "netplan.sh" by following command
     $ sudo chmod +x netplan.sh
   * Execute the script by following command
     $ sudo ./netplan.sh
   * Validate bridge created
     $ ip a
   * Validate host-bridge network
     $ virsh net-list --all
     
3. On host machine: Creating a ubuntu guest VM 

   * Create a file named "ubuntu_guest.sh"
   * Crete a QEMU image for disk path
     $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu2204test.img 20G
   * Add executable permission for the script file "ubuntu_guest.sh" by following command
     $ sudo chmod +x ubuntu_guest.sh
   * Execute the script by following command
     $ sudo ./ubuntu_guest.sh

4. On host machine: Creating a centOS guest VM 
   
   * Create a file named "centos_guest.sh"
   * Create a QEMU image for disk path
     $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/centos9streamtest.img 20G
   * Add executable permission for the script file "centos_guest.sh" by following command
     $ sudo chmod +x centos_guest.sh
   * Execute the script by following command
     $ sudo ./centos_guest.sh
     
5. On Ubuntu guest vm: Configuring the Network
   
   * Create a file named "00-installer-config.yaml"
   * Create a script file named "guest_netplan.sh" 
   * Add executable permission for the script file "guest_netplan.sh" by following command
     $ sudo chmod +x guest_netplan.sh
   * Execute the script by following command
     $ sudo ./guest_netplan.sh
   * verify cat /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
   
6. On CentOS guest vm: Configuring the Network

   * Create a script file named "net_conf.sh"
   * Add executable permission for the script file "net_conf.sh" by following command
     $ sudo chmod +x net_conf.sh
   * Execute the script by following command
     $ sudo ./net_conf.sh

7. Testing / Verifying

   * Install any webservers on ubuntu and Centos guest VM
   * Access the webserver from other host02 connected to the same network switch
